# <center> 👋 Hello! I am Jessica, and Welcome to my GitHub.</center>

### I'm a full stack developer living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I like to work on full-stack applications using JavaScript, React, and Node.js.


- In September 2020 I completed a second 8 week project with https://the-collab-lab.codes/ on team TCL-30! If you would like to see the project progress, check out the repository at https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-30-whats-near-me. This project uses Google Maps and Wikipedia to show the user what nifty things might be nearby!

- 🔭 I finished my 8 weeks working with https://the-collab-lab.codes/ on team TCL-23! Check out our project repository at https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-23-smart-shopping-list. It is a shopping list that people can share with others, and that helps track the user's shopping habits.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about front-end development, as well as accessibility. Did you know WAVE and Lighthouse aren't enough? I know that now! 

- 💬 Ask me about neurodivergency as a woman shifting into technology.

- 👩‍🌾 Random fact: I was a farmer! 🦙 🐓 🌽 🍅 🥬 🚜 Have since downsized to being a gardener 🌻 🌿 🍄 🌱 🍉
